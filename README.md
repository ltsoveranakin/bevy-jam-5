# Dont-Chill-Out

This is a platformer game in which you are a snowman who must pass each level during both the day and night.
But be quick! Taking too long during the day can make the nighttime more difficult.
Hide under shade to remain safe from the blazing sun.

You can move with keys "A,D,Left Arrow,Right Arrow" to move horizontally, and keys "W,Space,Up Arrow" to jump.

This project was created for the 5th Bevy Game Jam, which was hosted from July 20th 2024 through July 29th 2024.
